1,White,Chablis,France,2019,Famille Brocard,15.9,7,"Great honeyed fruit character with a succulent minerality, hints of citrus and juicy apples on the palate with a dry almost chalky finish."
2,White,Chablis,France,2018,Jean Durup,18.2,0,"This is textbook Chablis from one of the area's most successful producers. It has green-tinged hues, an elegant slightly steely quality with aromas and flavours of freshly baked brioche."
3,White,Chablis,France,2017,Daniel-Etienne Defaix,22.5,0,"Old vine cuvée from one of the top growers in Chablis. Defaix wines have a depth and richness achieved through extended lees ageing which can make them taste as if they are oaked. Long, intense and complex."
4,Red,Grenache,France,2020,La Cabane Reserve,7.8,21,"This is a soft and easy going red from Grenache and Syrah grapes grown in the historic Languedoc countryside. It is full of ripe, spicy fruit with excellent concentration and is a fine example of modern French wine."
5,Red,Rioja,Spain,2018,Vega Tinto,8.2,14,"Bodegas Rioja Vega take super, ripe, red grapes from the Rioja Alta, blend in some from the Rioja Baja and make a pure, fruity, vibrant young Joven wine just from the Tempranillo variety. It’s found all over Spain but seems to do brilliantly in Rioja where the balance and flavour work so well. There’s depth of flavour too, all very fruity with plum and blueberry notes – but this is un-oaked Spanish red wine so you get a very pure flavour. Try it with ham or a mild hard cheese, although it will stand up to most meaty dishes."
6,Red,Merlot,France,2016,Jean-Pierre Moueix,16.6,3,"Libourne-based négociants J-P Moueix are specialists in the wines of that region and their Saint-Emilion, soft and plummy, is one of the very best available. This is superb value so don't be put off by the lack of a château name."
7,Red,Pinor Noir,France,2015,Chambertin Grand Cru,320.0,0,"Superb nose, richly fruity yet creamy. Tense in the mouth with loads of fruit and density which grows fatter as you savour it. Super length, great structure and a lovely balance."
8,Red,Pinot Noir,France,2016,Bonnes Mares Grand Cru,290.0,0,"Full of fresh, dark fruit character on both the nose and the palate, creamy black cherries and dark raspberries vie for attention amongst a note of clove spice and a delicious creamy texture."
9,Red,Rioja,Spain,2018,Aldonia Vendimia,9.2,17,"Lovely cherry fruit with a bright character of crystallised strawberries and cranberries. Richer on the palate with liquorice, citrus, chocolate and vanilla all vying for attention."
10,Rose,Grenache,Spain,2019,Pleno Rosada,6.95,19,"Easy going rosé with attractive strawberry fruit, juicy and fresh, from a modern bodega in the Navarra region of Spain."
11,Red,Cabernet Sauvignon,Spain,2015,Torres Mas La Plana,47.0,6,"Full of character this has notes of cassis, truffle, plums, liquorice, fig and a lick of delicious toasty vanilla oak on the finish. Torres' flagship wine, easy to see where their heart lies."
12,White,Muscat,Spain,2019,Vina Esmerelda,9.8,13,"An exotic, perfumed nose with beautiful floral hints, a little residual sugar gives ripeness and tropical fruit character to the palate. The finish is fresh and clean."
13,White,Prensal Blanc,Spain,2018,Susana (Sempre...) Blanco,12.5,12,"Succulent with juicy grapefruit character, some richer rounder Chardonnay fruit on the middle of the palate with almost tropical fruit hints but with enough freshness and vivacity on the finish."
14,White,Macabeo,Spain,2019,Pleno Blanco,6.95,16,"Fresh and crisp dry white with hints of tropical fruit, smooth and well balanced. Very well made wine from a go-ahead bodega."
15,Red,Sangiovese,Italy,2019,Amanti del Vino,6.95,11,"This has juicy, soft fruit with hints of black cherries and plums. Attractive, easy going wine from Emilia-Romagna."
